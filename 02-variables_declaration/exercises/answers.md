## Q1

Golang variables can be declared without specifying a type by using the ":=" short variable declaration syntax, which infers the type of the variable from the value being assigned to it.

## Q2

The main difference between short variable declaration and regular variable declaration in Golang is that the former allows for declaring and initializing a variable at the same time using the ":=" syntax, while the latter separates the declaration and initialization steps.
